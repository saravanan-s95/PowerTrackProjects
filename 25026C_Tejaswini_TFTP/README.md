Trivial File Transfer Protocol Client and Server

Compiling the executables:
To make the client and server, use: make
To make the server only, use: make server
To make the client only, use: make client
To delete the server and client binaries, use: make clean
The output binaries will be 'server' and 'client' in the same directory.

Starting the server:
Usage: ./server <port number>
Example: 
To start the server on port 3333: 

./server 3333

It will go into a standby state waiting for a new connection.

Using the client:
Usage: ./client <server ip> <port> <filename> <output filename> [get|put]

Example:
To fetch getthisfile.txt from the directory the server program is in on the 
server with ip address 192.168.1.100 on port 4444 and download it to the 
client:

./client 192.168.1.100 4444 getthisfile.txt saveithere.txt get

To upload the file written with get back to the server with the name 
newfilename.txt:

./client 192.168.1.100 4444 saveithere.txt newfilename.txt put
